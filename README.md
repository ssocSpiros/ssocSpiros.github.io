Create sophisticated formatting for your prose and code on GitHub with simple syntax.

Headings
To create a heading, add one to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the hierarchy level and typeface size of the heading.

# A first-level heading
## A second-level heading
### A third-level heading
Screenshot of rendered GitHub Markdown showing sample h1, h2, and h3 headers, which descend in type size and visual weight to indicate descending hierarchy level.

When you use two or more headings, GitHub automatically generates a table of contents that you can access by clicking  within the file header. Each heading title is listed in the table of contents and you can click a title to navigate to the selected section.

Screenshot of the README file in the GitHub Docs open source repository with the drop-down menu for the table of contents exposed. The table of contents icon is outlined in dark orange.

Styling text
You can indicate emphasis with bold, italic, strikethrough, subscript, or superscript text in comment fields and .md files.
